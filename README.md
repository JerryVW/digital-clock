<h2>Summary</h2>

I have had a desire to become a programmer for some time now. I have an associates degree in programming, I've read the Head First Javascript book and taken some Udemy courses. But now it is time to build projects.

I decided to make a simple clock app as a first app so I could start small and work My way up to bigger projects. This was an interesting and challenging project to get right. From getting the time to change at 12 properly and switching between AM ans PM. Working on this first project has made me realize I have made the right choice for a new career.
